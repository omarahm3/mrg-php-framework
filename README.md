This project is a self-learning project or a kind of a PHP playground, where I'm planning to use it to explore some of the advanced stuff of PHP or mostly to just explore how modern PHP frameworks are working by trying to implement some of their features here, since i'm more focused on another languages/techs right now.

> Most of the current code is implemented by me just following through [this amazing video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ERdu4k62wI) by Zura
